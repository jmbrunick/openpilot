"""Replays of real Oct 10, 2026 drives (dongle 1c95345a3286a5db) through ConeLineDetector.

Each fixture is the radar-rate input radard hands the detector, cut from the rlog
(gzip JSON, base64 so it diffs and pushes as text):
liveTracks points (pre-filtered to near-stationary returns), vEgo, the model path,
road edges and yaw rate. `t` is seconds from the start of the cut.

  17c_cone_zone   0000017c 17:30:00–17:33:30 CT. Drums in the closed left lane,
                  then channelizers on the left line, 46–70 mph. 112907e9 saw nothing.
  17b_cone_pass   0000017b 16:47:55–16:48:45 CT. Drums 1.5–2.5 m left at 54 mph.
                  Must stay a left line with wouldSteer pointing right.
  17b_town_parked 0000017b 16:41:20–16:43:00 CT. Town, parked cars, an overpass
                  pier and sign poles; includes the 16:42:24 parked rejection.
  17b_parked_1647 / 17b_parked_1650   the 16:47:01 and 16:50:21 parked rejections.
